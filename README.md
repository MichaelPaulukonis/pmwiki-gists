pmwiki-gists
============

Easily embed gists into your [pmwiki](http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/) pages using only the gist ID.

Inspired by, and uses the javascript code from https://github.com/blairvanderhoof/gist-embed

Currently, only the simple form of gist inclusion -- _Loading a gist_ -- has been implemented.

The following forms are planned for the future:

 - Loading a gist with all line numbers removed
 - Loading a gist with footer removed
 - Loading a gist with both footer and line numbers removed
 - Loading a gist with multiple files
 - Loading a single file from a gist (example-file2.html)
 - Loading a single line number from a gist (line 2)
 - Loading a range of line numbers from a gist (line 2 through 4)
 - Loading a single line and a range of line numbers from a gist (line 1 and line 3 through 4)
 - Loading a list of line numbers from a gist (line 2, 3, 4)
 - Loading a code element without a gist id data attribute
